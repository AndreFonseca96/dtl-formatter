# DTL Editor Application

A modern, cross-platform desktop application for parsing, editing, and formatting and editing DTL.

---

# Domain Toggle Language (DTL)

**DTL** is a lightweight domain-specific language for defining and managing feature toggle rules.  
It provides a clear, human-readable syntax for describing conditions under which a feature should be enabled or disabled.

---

## Why DTL?

Managing feature toggles often becomes messy when rules are hidden deep in code or scattered across config files.  
**DTL** solves this by:

1. **Clarity** ‚Äì A consistent, structured syntax.
2. **Simplicity** ‚Äì Easy to read, write, and validate.
3. **Flexibility** ‚Äì Supports multiple properties, operators, and logical clauses.
4. **Cross-platform tooling** ‚Äì A lightweight desktop editor/formatter (built with Avalonia UI) helps create and validate rules.

## üìã DTL Format Support

The application supports DTL rules in the following format:

```

- `equals` - Exact match (e.g., "status equals active")
- `gt` - Greater than (e.g., "version gt 1.0")
- `gte` - Greater than or equal (e.g., "version gte 1.0")
- `lt` - Less than (e.g., "version lt 2.0")
- `lte` - Less than or equal (e.g., "version lte 2.0")

### Logical Operators

- `AND` - Logical AND between clauses or rules
- `OR` - Logical OR between clauses or rules

### Namespace Organization

- `DTLFormatterApp.Models` - Data models for rules and expressions
- `DTLFormatterApp.Services` - Business logic, parsing, and UI management services
- `DTLFormatterApp.Views` - UI components and windows
- `DTLFormatterApp` - Root namespace for the application
